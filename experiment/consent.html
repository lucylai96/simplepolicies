                To understand how people learn.
        </p>

        <p>
                <strong>What you will do in this research:</strong>
                You will be pressing buttons in response to images on the screen to gain monetary rewards. The task is very simple, and all instructions will be clearly explained to you.
        </p>
        <p >
                <strong>Time required:</strong>
                This study consists of 3 experimental parts and 1 survey. The whole series of experiments (Parts 1-3) should take about 15 minutes, and the survey should take about 10 minutes. The whole HIT should take you about 30 minutes of work time to complete (not including self-paced breaks).
        </p>
                <strong>Risks:</strong>
                There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and pressing buttons on the keyboard for the duration of the experiment.
        </p>
        <p >
                <strong>Benefits:</strong>
                The study provides important information about the nature of learning and decision making.
        </p>
        <p >
                <strong>Compensation:</strong>
                You will receive $4 base pay for completing the HIT + $0-4 bonus based on your performance across Parts 1-3 of the task. The average payout of this HIT should be around $6. You must complete all parts + survey to be paid for the HIT.
